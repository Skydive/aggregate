# Aggregate
Due to a range of security issues, and my underlying general hatred of node.js. I decided to spend about two days learning rust and writing a replacement fast, parallel and stable build tool for producing a website.

The project entered a usable state in ~40 hours over the course of two days of intense programming. I will continue to work on this in a less intense manner and when necessary during the development of projects which are dependent on this tool functioning accordingly.
